# Fallout Community Edition Assets

Someday it will be a place for modernized and/or additional assets for [Fallout Community Edition](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout1-ce).

Currently it's just a bunch of scripts decompiled from SSL (INT) to Lua. Because of the differencies in these two languages the scripts require extensive review. The idea is to figure out transition approach, engine requirements and time needed to perform it on scale (for Fallout 2 and big mods).
